usage:
	./server [port]
		defaults to port 5555 if a port isn't included

	./client [username] [ip] [port]
		username needs to be less than 100 chars
		ip needs to be in the form xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.
		port is optional
		you can't include a port number if no ip was given
			(either include ip and port, or just the ip)

omissions
	when a client connects, they do not get a list of other connected users

notes
	client.c is extremely similar to the client.c from the previous assignment. The only change
		was I enforce a username char limit in the main function.
